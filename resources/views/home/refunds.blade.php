            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>RETURN AND PROOF APPROVAL POLICY FOR CUSTOM ORDERS</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">We guarantee and stand behind the quality of our products. If we make a
                mistake, we will fix it or provide a refund. All claims will be reviewed by our customer service
                department before processing. Claims must be filed within 2 business days of your receipt of garments.
                Please email your claims to customer service at <a
                        href="mailto:support@greekhouse.org">support@greekhouse.org</a>. If we are at fault for the
                unacceptable product, a replacement or a refund of the product will be sent to you within 4 weeks of our
                receipt of defective product. Items cannot be sent in without authorization, if any items are received
                before authorization for return, they will be held and shipped back at your own expense.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Once you approve an artwork proof, unless the product we deliver is drastically
                different from the mock up, Greek House is not liable for any claims by the customer that the product is
                not acceptable. Please review artwork proofs carefully for design measurements and colors. Please keep
                in mind that the garment, design, placement, and colors represented in artwork proofs area visual
                representation of the product. Actual garment, design placement, and colors may vary from the provided
                artwork proof. We make every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors of our products that
                appear in artwork proofs. However, as the actual colors you see will depend on your monitor, we cannot
                guarantee that your monitorâ€™s display of any color will be accurate. The best way to guarantee color
                accuracy is for you to view an actual hard copy of an official Pantone color chart. We mix our inks
                based on the official Pantone color-mixing guide. Once a final artwork proof is approved, no changes can
                be made to the order for any reason.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Orders over 50 pieces are subject to a 2% machine defect allowance. All
                customers should order enough excess garments to cover the possibility of machine defects. We do our
                best to avoid any machine defects, but claims related to machine defect will be denied.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If you have any questions regarding the above policies, please feel free to
                contact customer service at <a href="mailto:support@greekhouse.org">support@greekhouse.org</a></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>RETURN AND PROOF APPROVAL POLICY FOR INDIVIDUALLY PAID ORDERS</strong>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">An order cannot be exchanged, refunded or returned once the payment on an Order
                Campaign Closes. We don't allow for this because every order and/or campaign is made custom, and
                typically 1 bulk order of prints are completed.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>ORDER CANCELLATION</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">To provide you with the fastest service possible, once a custom order is in
                production, it cannot be canceled. We cannot make any changes or cancellations to any order once payment
                closes. Individual orders cannot be canceled once they enter our shipping process. For individual order,
                once you receive your package you can choose to exchange it for a full refund but not a replacement
                garment.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">ALL RETURNS AND EXCHANGES MUST BE MAILED TO THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS:</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">1342 N Highland Ave.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>TRANSIT TIME:</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Even if a rush fee is paid, or shipping method is upgraded by the customer,
                order delivery is still subject to UPS transit time. These are estimated shipping times, not exact
                shipping times.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>SHIPPING FOR CUSTOM ORDERS:</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">For orders less than 50 pieces, standard shipping and processing charges will
                apply. We offer free shipping on custom orders over 50 pieces. Unless the customer requests otherwise,
                all custom orders will be shipped via UPS Ground or a comparable shipping service from another shipping
                provider. At our discretion, we may ship any order via the shipping provider and service of our choice.
                The customer is responsible for any additional fees resulting from their request to change the shipping
                method or provider.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>SHIPPING FOR INDIVIDUAL ORDERS:</strong></p>

                most will be within 10 to 15. Please allow up to 4 weeks for your order to arrive. If you still have not
                received your purchase after 5 weeks, please notify <a
                        href="mailto:support@greekhouse.org">support@greekhouse.org</a>. Unless the customer requests
                otherwise, all individual orders will be shipped via UPS or USPS, or a comparable shipping service from
                another shipping provider. At our discretion, we may ship any order via the shipping provider and
                service of our choice. The customer is responsible for any additional fees resulting from their request
                to change the shipping method or provider.</p>
