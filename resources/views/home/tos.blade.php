            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">​We guarantee and stand behind the quality of our products. If we make a mistake, we will fix
                it. All claims will be reviewed by our customer service department before processing. Claims may be
                filed within 1 week of your receipt of garments. Please email your claims to customer service at <a
                        href="mailto:support@greekhouse.org"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span
                                style="text-decoration: underline;">support@greekhouse.org</span></span></a>. If we are at fault for the
                unacceptable product, a replacement of the product will be sent to you within 2 weeks of our receipt of
                defective product. Items cannot be sent in without authorization, if any items are received before
                authorization for return, they will be held and shipped back at your own expense.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Once you approve an artwork proof, unless the product we deliver is different from the mock
                up, Greek House is not liable for any claims by the customer that the product is not acceptable. Please
                review artwork proofs carefully for design measurements and colors. Please keep in mind that the
                garment, design, placement, and colors represented in artwork proofs area visual representation of the
                product. Actual garment, design placement, and colors may vary from the provided artwork proof. We make
                every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors of our products that appear in artwork
                proofs. However, as the actual colors you see will depend on your monitor, we cannot guarantee that
                your monitor’s display of any color will be accurate. The best way to guarantee color accuracy is for
                you to view an actual hard copy of an official Pantone color chart. We mix our inks based on the
                official Pantone color-mixing guide. Once a final artwork proof is approved, no changes can be made to
                the order for any reason.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Orders over 50 pieces are subject to a 2% machine defect allowance. All customers should
                order enough excess garments to cover the possibility of machine defects. We do our best to avoid any
                machine defects, but claims related to machine defect will be denied.</p>
