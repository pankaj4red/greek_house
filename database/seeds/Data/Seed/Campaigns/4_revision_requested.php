Please give the shirt some dimension by using gold and white throughout the city scape. If you need to add a third color feel free to use the lighter green color also on the beer shirts attached with the gold / green color.

Hi Nick great job. Just a few more things we\'ll need...

Please see the changes below.

Back of the T- shirt
Please add a sun (as shown in model picture)
Please add rain drops (as seen in model picture)
Please make the road white instead of yellow.
The buildings need more dimension and I think using more white can do this. Feel free to use the white gold and color of the shirt.
Also there should be a space between the road and the buildings so you can see the t-shirt (reference model photo for this as well)
Take out the fillers in between buildings give them more space / t shirt color (like model pic)
The yellow color should be more gold / sunset color not yellow if possible.

If possible please make these changes and upload two different ones. The back in the new gold color and then another one of the back with the light green color (reference the uploaded picture) so we can compare the gold and white versus the light green and white.

Pocket of shirt
Please thin out the lines of the cube and take off the rounded edges
Thin all lines down in the circle and thin the 401 LOFTS and AKRON, OH.
You have the perfect idea just needs to be skinnier & the thinness should match the look of the font of the back.
Our apartment is really upscale & modern in downtown Akron we want our logo / shirts to show this.',

1. the “p” in alpha is a little too close to the word “kennesaw” , so if u could just space it just a tad.
2. the “g” in spring is also a little close to the word “in”.
3. The word “written” looks a little funky with the first “t” being lower but I think kerning would fix the problem.
4. the location and date centering looks odd to me. I think putting the word “centre” under “cobb galleria” would help make it more symmetrical. ',
